        McKenzie Rose West is an illustrator originally from <span aria-hidden="true">Las Vegas, Nevada</span>.

        Watercolors are McKenzie’s primary media to experiment with. She loves creating playful illustrations for 
        the children’s market. She graduated with a BA in illustration from BYU-Idaho. After graduation, McKenzie 
        worked with a large homeschool program doing various projects including: history stories, book covers, 
        young reader books, and beginner chapter books.

        McKenzie now lives in Utah Valley with her wonderful husband, Kyle, where she still loves to escape 
        to the mountains, hike, try new restaurants, and add yet another new plant to her home.

        Currently, McKenzie West lives in <span aria-hidden="true">Lehi, Utah</span>, also known as Happy Valley, with her wonderful husband Kyle 
        and her many house plants to keep her company. She loves to hike the Wasatch mountains where her mind can 
        wonder, explore, and freely day dream. Outside of painting and doodling, McKenzie spends her time collecting 
        flowers to press, roller blading, and trying out new recipes from around the world with her husband.

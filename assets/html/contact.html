        Like all artists, I started my career at the age of five when I could hold a 
        crayon by myself. Now that I am 23 years old I find myself drawing and cannot 
        get enough of it. I get a thrill from creating brushstrokes that breathe life 
        in my characters and stories. Illustration isn't just my profession it's my 
        passion.

        I graduated from Brigham Young University-Idaho with a Bachelor of Arts in Illustration. 
        I have been published several times in the home school program, <i>The 
          Good and the Beautiful</i>, and am currently working on a very large upcoming project for 
          them.

          When I'm not working on art, you can find me hiking, jamming to music when I 
          think nobody is looking, sneaking chocolate out of the cupboards, or fancying 
          myself to my sweet husband's homemade Italian food.
